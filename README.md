# LinuxErrorPractice
The purpose of this assignment is to get you familiar with how to read the error messages g++ produces. Each of these files has an error in it that prevents it from compiling. 

The best way to approach debug is to have two putty shells open. One where you are viewing the file, and one where you are running the compile command.

For each file run the command:

g++ -Wall _filename_.cpp -o _filename_

Where _filename_ is the name of the file, like Error1.
